There are 3 levels of git config; project, global and system.

    project: Project configs are only available for the current project and stored in .git/config in the project's directory.
    global: Global configs are available for all projects for the current user and stored in ~/.gitconfig.
    system: System configs are available for all the users/projects and stored in /etc/gitconfig.

Create a project specific config, you have to execute this under the project's directory:

$ git config user.name "John Doe" 

Create a global config:

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"

Create a system config:

$ git config --system user.name "John Doe" 

And as you may guess, project overrides global and global overrides system.
