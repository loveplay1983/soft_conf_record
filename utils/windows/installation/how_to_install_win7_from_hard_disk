Sometimes you may encounter problems like your "PE" doesn't work, under such circumstance, the following steps may help:
1. Copy boot folder and bootmgr from the installation iso to drive C (let's say you want to use C as sys drive)
2. Copy all the files from iso file to your hard disk (different drive on your local machine)
3. Create "sources" folder on your drive C and copy "install.wim, boot.wim" from iso file to it
4. Start->run->cmd   "c:\boot\bootsect.exe /nt60 c:"
5. If the system prompt something relates to "successfully", its done.
