You have this command:

ed2k - aMule eD2k link parser

and it comes with the amule-utils package

sudo apt install amule-utils 
if you have a list ed2k links (separated by newlines) from emule or other client you can just use xargs:

cat links.txt | xargs -L1 ed2k
For this to work amule or amuled need to be already started, you will see the files were added in the aMule Log tab

BTW if you have ' (single quotes) characters in the ed2k link you need to replace them with escaped once \'
